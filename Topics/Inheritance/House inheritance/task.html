  <p>There is a program that reads two numbers from the input, each in a new line:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>The first one represents the number of <strong>rooms</strong> in the house<strong>.</strong> It helps define and create an instance of a class depending on that number according to the following rules: 1 for Cabin, 2-3 for Bungalow, 4 for Cottage, 5-7 for Mansion, 8-10 for Palace. If the number is lower than 1, it's a Cabin. If the number is greater than 10, it's a Palace.</li> 
   <li>The second one is the <strong>base price</strong> of this house. If this price is lower than 0, this house costs 0, if it is greater than 1_000_000, the base price is 1_000_000.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>There is also a <strong>coefficient</strong> per each class: 1 for Cabin, 1.2 for Bungalow, 1.25 for Cottage, 1.4 for Mansion, 1.6 for Palace.</p> 
  <p>The program should define which house needs to be built and calculate the <strong>final price </strong>of this house according to the next rule: <strong>base price * coefficient</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Fix the program below and implement the given logic.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-1138').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-1138" style="display:none;">
   Don't forget to print the integer, not a floating-point number!
  </div>
