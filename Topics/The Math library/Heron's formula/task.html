<h2>Heron's formula</h2>

  <p>A long time ago, 
   <strike>
    in a galaxy far, far away,
   </strike> when Patricia went to school, she did not like to use the Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle, because it seemed too complicated to her. Once she decided to help all the school students. How? She must write and distribute the program, calculating the area of a triangle by its three sides!</p> 
  <p>However, there was a problem: since Patricia did not like the formula, she never memorized it. Help her finish this act of kindness and write the program, that calculates the area of a triangle using the Heron's formula:</p> 
  <p><span class="math-tex">\[S=\sqrt{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}\]</span> where <span class="math-tex">\( p=\dfrac{a+b+c}2 \)</span> is the semi perimeter of a triangle. As the input, the program receives integers. The output is to be a real number, in our case, the area of the triangle.</p> 
  <p>Do not round the result.</p>
